1.1 Intro
We are Developing a decentralized computer system resembling Ethereum-Blockchain for few very specific reasons. At first, we are trying to reduce the power consumption by these system to half by making each pc connected to the internet as a participant on the network. We are indirectly using their resources but in return we will also reward them with a fraction of Ethereum for each successful mining operation. Second, the development of this project will lead to a greater number of people participating in smooth transition from web 2.0 to web 3.0 resulting in less iteration taken to evolve to its prime.
1.2	Scope

Methodology:
1.	First, we’re going to create the language for smart contracts.
2.	We’ll build a block chain which applies the unique technical implementation of Ethereum.
3.	Create a system that can support a network of servers. (Through this, we can have multiple machines running to support the decentralized computer)
4.	Build transaction and account objects. (This will help support the cryptocurrency and it will help describe how the decentralized computer state should change)
5.	Finally, we’ll build the state management object itself.
6.	Once all these components are working like a decentralized computer, we will achieve our goal of creating a decentralized computer like Ethereum.

The main issues that we are covering is: -
•	Power Consumption by the existing blockchain-Ethereum systems.
•	Complex technology takes time for new people to switch.
•	Complex financial system integration with modern computing and internet services.
•	Data security over the internet.


1.3	Applicability

The project’s direct and indirect applicability are in various field. First, the project will be a massive achievement for web 3.0 with a greater number of people coming on this revolutionary platform due to the use of easy & massive hit language. Second, we are trying to reduce the massive power consumption by the blockchain system by distributing the entire workload from a single warehouse to each normal pc users resulting in a far less power consumption and smoother workload efficiency.


1.4	Achievements

It is now web 2.0 which is running where we can interact with the web and contribute to the web development. It is an actually depending on Blockchain Technology very much, it is accumulating a substantial amount of energy consumption which is equal to a country Argentina in 2020 for Blockchain data mining power consumption which is an environmental issue. A lot of survey concludes, all the Blockchain algorithms running on a network uses 40% renewable energy. 
This means 60 % energy is non-renewable which is totally a waste. We are preparing this project with JavaScript as if we don’t want to deploy the ether on a dedicated server, combining the machines that the individual possesses at their homes. If we take a fractional processing power of them because their machine sits idle sometimes for example game downloading etc. Now if we run these the ones that the Ethereum blockchain machine run the code, the miners who establish the validity is awarded with an Eth coin after Eth mining, we will provide those people from whom we are consuming the power with Eth coins.
The power consumption can be dismantled therefore, we concentrate the entire warehouse, the entire machine and the entire Blockchain network to a single machine. Thus, we are giving everyone a chance to participate in the Blockchain network and all we are demanding is power consumption from their machine. They can do it with their machines only like participating in the Blockchain Network which is a very good achievement of the project.
